We are preparing the app for an closed testing round with ~250 users.

The App helps people with improving their state of mind with targeted recommendations for music and breathing exercises. The app makes copies of three currated master playlists on Spotify, each for one particular emotional target states, on the users account. Once copied, the user can then alter their personal playlists to their preferences. The user can choose whether to have a private or a public copy.

Used to generate a public copy of a master playlist for the user.

Used to generate a private copy of a master playlist for the user.

The app is currently in closed testing, as such we can not easily invite you and for that reason we included a screen cast. If you absolutely need access to the app, please contact us.
